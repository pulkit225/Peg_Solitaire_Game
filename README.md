# Peg_Solitaire_Game
A Peg Solitaire game also known as HI-Q game, is a board game for one player which involves movement of pegs/ marbles on a board with holes.


Peg solitaire is a board game for one player. It is played on a board which has positions in a geometric arrangement. Each position can be either free or occupied. Usually, the positions are marked by indentations that can be occupied by a peg or a marble. We need to first describe the initial state of the board, then define the desired state of the board and pegs, try to find out conditions that initially fill the whole board according to the conditions and then apply an algorithm that applies transformation until desired state is reached.
